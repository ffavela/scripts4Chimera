Prerequisites

Make sure you have python3 and gnuplot.

To install;

1) mkdir ~/.myPrograms (if it doesn't already exist)
2) cd ~/.myPrograms
3) ln -s route/directory/for/format4SpreadSheet.py format4SpreadSheet
4) ln -s route/directory/for/simpleGpltScript.sh simpleGpltScript
5) Add the following line at the end of your .bashrc (or .zshrc ...):

             export PATH=$PATH:~/.myPrograms

Any new terminal (or after sourcing the current one) should be able to
find "format4SpreadSheet" when typed.
